		<p>I am a graphic design student who is interested in growing and developing my skills as an artist and creative. I am learning about the creative process and various unique methods used be designers in the past. I really enjoy experimenting with visuals and seeing what is in my capabilities to create. </p>

		<figcaption>Swiss Poster</figcaption>
<p>This assignment was to demonstrate our understanding of the Swiss aesthetic in design. This poster was constructed using grids, a visual hierarchy, lineals, and a limited palette of 2 colors. This poster was printed on white paper advertising a scientific seminar which took  place both online and in person. </p>

		<figcaption>Global Comps</figcaption>
<p>This assignment was to design a poster centered around one of the 17 global sustainable development goals. My poster is centered around Life Below Water. I designed the fishhook to draw attention to the issues with overfishing, and the dangerous impacts this habit has on the environment. I drew a school of fish in the background, playing around with varying sizes and colors to create a sense of depth. </p>

<p>This was a clipping mask project. I was getting more acquainted with the mechanics of photoshop during this assignment. I used photos I took along with provided stock images of the hand and phone. I changed the background to a blurred concert, and I used a clipping mask to make the musician appear clearly on the phone. </p>

    <img src="Images/Interactive_Port.jpg" width="1000" height="800" alt="Grunge Homepage"/>
		<figcaption>Grunge Homepage</figcaption>
<p>This was a project where I tried my hand at coding a website. I took inspiration from David Carsonâ€™s online portfolio and tried to mimic that same style. I found some grungy fonts to include along with various covers form the Ray Gun magazine. Although this is just a snapshot, the nav bar leads to details about other artists like Art Chantry and Chris Ashworth, along with examples of other grunge works and a brief history on the aesthetic. </p>

<p>This was a personal project where I tested my limits and dove heavily into pattern and textures. I pushed myself to stipple and sketch, but also to refine my work as well. I used this as an exercise in the creative process, playing with colors and layers to create something I am proud of. </p>

<p>This was another personal project where I experimented with optical illusions. I developed a system that allowed me to construct this effect without getting overwhelmed during the process. I constructed a template which I used to design symbols which I then pasted many times over to create a grid. I then made lots of colored bubbles to take up space behind the grid in various patterns, which is what actually creates the illusion of movement where there is none. </p>
